A progressive failure fatigue analysis of lattices

# Fatigue-analysis-Lattices 2d
The Python 3 code uses a progressive failure approach to analyze 2D hexagonal lattices.
Every lattice ligament is modelled as beam element.
The FE calculation uses the repository Anastruct https://github.com/ritchie46/anaStruct/blob/master/anastruct/basic.py
to evaluate displacements of beam elements.


# Fatigue-analysis-Lattices 3d
The Python 3 code uses a progressive failure approach to analyze 3D lattices diamond.
Every lattice ligament is modelled as beam element.
The FE calculation uses the repository Pynite https://github.com/JWock82/PyNite
to evaluate displacements of beam elements.

The program makes iterative fatigue calculations on lattice structures removing minimum life elements.
